Problem Statement:

A carbon di-oxide flooding technique is used to extract crude oil. The co2 floods oil pockets 
and displace the crude oil. In an experiment, flow tubes are dipped into sample oil pockets 
containing a known amount of oil. Using three different values flow pressure and three different values of dipping angle, the oil pockets are flooded with Co2, and the percentage of 
oil displaced recorded. Suppose you want to have a predictive model for the oil recovery as a 
function of dipping angle and flow pressure. Perform a model editing using linear model and calculate the RMSE corresponding to the linear 
model.
